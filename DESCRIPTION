Maintainer: Andrey Shabalin <ashabalin@vcu.edu>
Description: Interface for working with large matrices stored in files, not in computer memory.
     Supports multiple data types (double, integer, logical and raw) of different sizes (e.g. 8 and 4 byte real values).
     Access to parts of the matrix is done by indexing, exactly as with usual R matrices.
     Supports very large matrices (tested on multi-terabyte matrices), allowing for more than 2^32 rows or columns.
     Cross-platform as the package has R code only, no C/C++.
